# What it is?

This is my pet project. My motto is: "Constantly boost the expertise and gain new experience." Here I study new technologies, apply them in practice and get a hand of it.
Why simple math? This is my favorite school subject and I would like to present it in a visual and playful way.

You can check out the [demo here](https://gtm003.github.io/simple_math/).
